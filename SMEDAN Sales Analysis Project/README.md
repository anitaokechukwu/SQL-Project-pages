# SMEDAN Sales Analysis Project (Sweden Sales Dataset)

## Overview
This project analyzes sales transaction data using **MySQL** to uncover
business insights related to customer behavior, product performance,
sales channels, and revenue trends over time.

The analysis focuses on answering real-world business questions 
using **SQL querying techniques**, including filtering, aggregation, 
joins, window functions, and subqueries.  
It demonstrates how structured query logic can support
data-driven decision-making in sales and retail environments.
