# 📊 TFQ_SALES – Advanced SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview
The **TFQ_SALES** project demonstrates the application of **advanced SQL techniques**
to analyze retail business data and generate actionable insights.  
The analysis focuses on **employee compensation**, **departmental structure**,
and **store sales performance**, 
using real-world business questions to drive decision-making.

This project highlights proficiency in **subqueries, 
Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregate functions, 
conditional logic, and joins** for analytical reporting.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The analysis is based on three relational tables:

### **employee**
- `emp_id`
- `emp_name`
- `dept_name`
- `salary`

Contains employee demographic and salary information.

### **dept**
- `dept_id`
- `dept_name`

Stores department-level details.

### **sales**
- `store_id`
- `store_name`
- `cost`
- `quantity`

Holds transaction-level sales data.

## ❓ Key Business Questions & Analysis

### 👩‍💼 Employee Performance & Salary Insights
- Identify employees earning **above the company-wide average salary** using
scalar subqueries and CTEs.
- Determine the **highest-paid employee in each department**
using multi-row subqueries.
- Classify employees as **Above Average** or **Average/Below** earners 
using subqueries within the `SELECT` clause.
- Detect **departments without assigned employees** using single-column subqueries.

### 🏪 Store Sales & Profitability
- Identify stores with **total sales cost above the average** across 
all stores using nested subqueries and CTEs.
- Find stores that sold **more units than the average quantity sold**
using the `HAVING` clause with aggregate functions.

---

## 🧠 SQL Techniques Used
- **Subqueries:** Scalar, multiple-row, and correlated subqueries  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Improved query readability and structure  
- **Aggregate Functions:** `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()` for analytical calculations  
- **Conditional Logic:** `CASE WHEN` for employee classification  
- **Joins:** Combined multiple tables and derived datasets for comprehensive analysis  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A small group of employees earn significantly above
the organizational average, indicating salary
concentration at senior or high-impact roles.
- Certain departments lack active employees, 
highlighting potential organizational or data integrity gaps.
- Several stores consistently outperform the average 
in both **sales cost** and **unit quantity**, identifying them as top-performing outlets.
- Average-based comparisons reveal performance
outliers that may not be visible using raw totals alone.
