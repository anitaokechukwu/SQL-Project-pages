JIJI SQL Project – Key Insights
1. Employee Salary Analysis

Managers earn the highest salaries across the organization, 
indicating that compensation is strongly tied to leadership roles.

Analysts and Developers earn moderately high salaries but
remain below the managerial pay band.

Employees earning above ₦50,000 represent a smaller
portion of the workforce, highlighting a clear salary stratification.

Salary ordering shows a consistent hierarchy, which 
suggests a structured and well-defined compensation system.

Business Implication:
Management roles drive higher payroll costs. HR can use this insight
for workforce planning and salary benchmarking.

2. Customer Location Insights

Lagos has the highest number of customers compared to other cities.

Abuja follows but with noticeably fewer customers.

Customer distribution is geographically concentrated rather than evenly spread.

Business Implication:
Marketing campaigns and promotions should prioritize Lagos, 
while Abuja presents growth potential for customer acquisition.

3. Sales & Order Trends

Monthly order analysis shows fluctuations in purchasing activity rather than consistent growth.

March 2023 recorded higher order activity compared to earlier months.

Some customers placed multiple orders, contributing significantly to total sales value.

Business Implication:
Seasonal or promotional effects may influence customer purchasing behavior.
Targeted campaigns during high-activity months could maximize revenue.

4. High-Value Customers

Customers with total purchases exceeding ₦1,000 account 
for a significant share of overall revenue.

A small group of customers contributes disproportionately to sales volume.

Business Implication:
Retention strategies such as loyalty programs or 
personalized offers should focus on these high-value customers.

5. Order Distribution Analysis

Most orders are evenly distributed across different dates,
with a few peak days recording higher order counts.

Order volume does not spike uniformly, suggesting irregular purchasing behavior.

Business Implication:
Operational planning (staffing, inventory) should account
for demand variability rather than assuming consistent daily sales.

6. Overall Business Observations

Employee compensation aligns with job roles and responsibilities.

Customer concentration in Lagos presents both stability and risk due to geographic dependence.

Revenue is driven more by repeat and high-value customers than by one-time buyers.

SQL analysis reveals actionable insights that support decision-making in HR, sales, and marketing.

📌 Key Takeaway

This analysis demonstrates how structured SQL queries can transform
raw transactional data into meaningful business insights.
The findings support strategic decisions in employee management,
customer targeting, and revenue optimization.
